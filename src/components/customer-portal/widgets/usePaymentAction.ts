 * Follows a payment or setup action and keeps the URL visible.
 *
 * The open happens in an async callback after the API responds, not directly in
 * the customer's click, which is what popup blockers stop. So the URL is also
 * surfaced for the caller to display — a blocked redirect must stay recoverable.
 *
 * An action with no URL is a legitimate outcome: `use_saved_method` can settle a
 * charge outright, and a provider that vaults server-to-server returns type
 * 'none'. Callers should refresh rather than wait for a redirect.
