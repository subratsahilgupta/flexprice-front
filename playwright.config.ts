 * Layout:
 *   e2e/public/**      routes reachable signed out — no credentials required
 *   e2e/journeys/**    business workflows: create a customer, edit a subscription
 *   e2e/regression/**  one focused test per historical bug — the permanent net
 *   e2e/smoke/**       the few flows that prove a deployment is usable at all
 *
 * Tags select across those folders. Every spec carries at least one:
 *   @smoke       deployment health — fast, read-only
 *   @critical    must not break; what a pull request is gated on
 *   @regression  a bug that shipped once and must not return
 *
 * The `setup` project logs in once through the real UI and writes a storage state
 * every other project reuses. Doing it through the UI rather than by minting a token
 * keeps the suite honest about the login path and works unchanged whether the target
 * authenticates through Supabase or the self-hosted provider.
